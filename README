            GeckoGames Web Game Engine 2D (ggwge2D)
---------------------------------------------------------------

  Created to make web game development easier, this game engine
follows the basic outline that we have generally followed when
producing 3-dimensional games such as Splat! (geckogames/splat)
and Tetramino Escape (geckogames/escapethevoid).

  This game engine is still in the works and we do not reccomend
using it yet for any new games.
