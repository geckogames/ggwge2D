            GeckoGames Web Game Engine 2D (ggwge2D)
---------------------------------------------------------------

  Created to make web game development easier, this game engine
follows the basic outline that we have generally followed when
producing 3-dimensional games such as Splat! (geckogames/splat)
and Tetramino Escape (geckogames/escapethevoid).

  ggwge2D is still in the works and we do not recommend using
it yet for any new games.

  We develop ggwge2D on GNU/Linux and Windows 8 Systems,
and we test the game using Firefox (and occasionally Chrome.)
Therefore, the latest working version should always work well
on Firefox and will probably work on Chrome.

  ggwge2D is licensed under the GNU General Public License,
version 3.0, or, at your option, any later version.
