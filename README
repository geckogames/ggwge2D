            GeckoGames Web Game Engine 2D (ggwge2D)
---------------------------------------------------------------

  Created to make web game development easier, this game engine
follows the basic outline that we have generally followed when
producing 3-dimensional games such as Splat! (geckogames/splat)
and Tetramino Escape (geckogames/escapethevoid).

  ggwge2D is still in the works and we do not recommend using
it yet for any new games.

  We develop ggwge2D on GNU/Linux and Windows 8 Systems,
and we test the game using Firefox (and occasionally Chrome.)
Therefore, the latest working version should always work well
on Firefox and will probably work on Chrome.

  Please note that ggwge2d games need to be served from a web
server instead of accessed from the browser through file:///,
in order to make XMLHttpRequests work properly. This is not a
bug in ggwge2d, it is an annoyance in web standards and/or
individual browser standards.

  The main branch is for the latest version of the project
that meets the following criteria:
    1. It has been tested
    2. It works with no known errors or bugs
    3. Changes are complete - There are no features that exist
        but can't be used as intended, due to a lack of other
        features which changes depend on.

  All changes (other than quick doc fixes) must be done in
branches other than the master branch. Please make your own
branch, with a name that is either describing what happens in
that branch, or is your username. Once you have tested your
branch's code, you can then put in a pull request to put the
code in the master branch.

  Some branches of interest apart from master include:
   - The branch for the biggest contributor to the project
      (Currently htmlguy, with branch 'htmlguy')
   - Branches for official geckogames members:
      htmlguy's branch - 'htmlguy'
